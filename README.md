# BaitBlock
## Shellhacks 2024 Project

**Project Overview**

BaitBlock is a web application designed to detect and flag phishing emails, providing users with a robust defense against online scams. By leveraging advanced algorithms and the ChatGPT API, BaitBlock analyzes the content, context, and structure of emails to identify potentially malicious messages. Its primary goal is to protect users from falling victim to phishing attempts by detecting and flagging suspicious emails in real time, thereby safeguarding personal, financial, and organizational data.


**Key Features**


**Email Phishing Detection:** BaitBlock uses the ChatGPT API to analyze the language and context of incoming emails, identifying phishing attempts through subtle indicators such as unusual requests, deceptive language, or suspicious links and attachments.

**Contextual Analysis:** The ChatGPT integration enables BaitBlock to understand the context of email content, such as detecting fake sender identities, misleading subject lines, and social engineering tactics designed to manipulate recipients.

**Advanced Threat Intelligence:** By continuously learning from flagged emails, BaitBlock enhances its detection capabilities, adapting to new phishing tactics and evolving threats.

**User-Friendly Dashboard:** BaitBlock offers a user-friendly interface where users can review flagged emails.



**Future Aims**


**Real-Time Flagging and Alerts:** When a suspicious email is detected, BaitBlock flags it and sends an immediate alert to the user, providing details on why the email was flagged and advising on safe handling practices.

**Protection Across Platforms:** BaitBlock integrates with popular email clients (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) and works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, ensuring consistent protection regardless of where users access their emails.

**Enhanced AI and Contextual Detection:** BaitBlock plans to further develop its use of the ChatGPT API and other natural language processing (NLP) tools to detect increasingly sophisticated phishing techniques, such as personalized scams targeting specific individuals or organizations.

**Multilingual Email Analysis:** As phishing threats are global, BaitBlock aims to support multilingual email analysis, enabling it to detect scams written in various languages, dialects, and regional communication styles.

**Integration with Enterprise Security Systems:** BaitBlock seeks to expand its capabilities to enterprise environments, offering integration with corporate email security systems and providing detailed analytics on phishing threats targeting organizations.

**Advanced Machine Learning Feedback Loops:** Future iterations will include feedback loops where user interactions with flagged emails inform and improve BaitBlock’s detection algorithms, enhancing accuracy over time.

**Training Modules for Phishing Awareness:** BaitBlock aims to develop interactive training modules that simulate real-world phishing scenarios, educating users on how to identify phishing emails independently, even when automated tools are not available.

**Phishing Threat Intelligence Sharing:** BaitBlock plans to collaborate with cybersecurity platforms to share data on new phishing threats, helping to build a more comprehensive global response to email-based scams.

**AI-Driven Email Scoring System:** BaitBlock will develop a scoring system that assigns risk levels to incoming emails, helping users quickly gauge the safety of messages and decide on appropriate actions.

**Protection for Communication Platforms:** Future versions aim to extend BaitBlock’s phishing detection capabilities beyond traditional email to other communication platforms, such as messaging apps and social media, where phishing attempts are also prevalent.
